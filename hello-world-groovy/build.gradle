//Uses GROOVY DSL

//keyword task is a method call on an api available on the gradle.build script

// () for method calls are optional, helloWorld, or the name is actually the first parameter of the task method call 

// This would also work -> task( "helloWorld" ) {

//this metho returns a new instance of type task

task helloWorld {
    
    // the do last statement ensures the method included is called at run time - lifecylce?
    doLast {
        //println is a method provided by groovy to print to stdout
        println "Hello world with Groovy DSL"
    }
